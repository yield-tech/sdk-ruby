# Ideally we should use RBS collections, but it's very incomplete and full of untyped:
# https://github.com/ruby/gem_rbs_collection/blob/main/gems/faraday/2.5/faraday.rbs
# Even the yard docs offer better specs:
# https://gemdocs.org/gems/faraday/2.13.1/
# We could contribute back, but it's much easier to scope this based on our actual usage.
